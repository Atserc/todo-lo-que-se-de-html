    The primary heading of a page or section should be marked up with an &lt;h1&gt; element, and subsequent headings should use &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt; elements as necessary. <br>
    Headings help to quickly break up content and establish hierarchy, and they are key identifiers for users reading a page. They also help search engines to index and determine the content on a page.

Headings are often followed by supporting paragraphs. Paragraphs are defined using the <p> block-level element. Paragraphs can appear one after the other, adding 
information to a page as desired. 
To make text bold and place a strong importance on it, we’ll use the <strong> inline-level element. There are two elements that will bold text for us: the <strong> and 
<b> elements. To italicize text, thereby placing emphasis on it, we’ll use the <em> inline-level element. The <em> element is used semantically to place a stressed emphasis 
on text; it is thus the most popular option for italicizing text. The other option, the <i> element, is used semantically to convey text in an alternative voice or tone, 
almost as if it were placed in quotation marks.

HTML5 introduced new structurally based elements, including the <header> (is used to identify the top of a page, article, section, or other segment of a page), 
<nav> (identifies a section of major navigational links on a page), <article> (is used to identify a section of independent, self-contained content), <section>  ( is used 
to identify a thematic grouping of content), <aside> (holds content, such as sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations, that is tangentially related to the content 
surrounding it), and <footer> (identifies the closing or end of a page, article, section, or other segment of a page) elements.

Links pointing to other pages of the same website will have a relative path, which does not include the domain (.com, .org, .edu, etc.) in the href attribute value. Linking 
to other websites outside of the current one requires an absolute path, where the href attribute value must include the full domain. Examples:
Relative Path -> <a href="about.html">About</a>
Absolute Path -> <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
To create an email link, the href attribute value needs to start with mailto: followed by the email address to which the email should be sent.
Example: <a href="mailto:shay@awesome.com?subject=Reaching%20Out&body=How%20are%20you">Email Me</a>
To trigger the action of opening a link in a new window, use the target attribute with a value of _blank. The target attribute determines exactly where the link will be 
displayed, and the _blank value specifies a new window. Example: <a href="http://shayhowe.com/" target="_blank">Shay Howe</a>

we can place an id attribute value of top on the <body> element. Now we can create an anchor element with an href attribute value of #top, pound sign and all, to link to 
the beginning of the <body> element. Example: 
<body id="top">
  ...
  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
  ...
</body>
